# Student’s Dropout and Academic Success Predictor
Many educational institutions put a high value
on monitoring and supporting university freshmen. The high
proportion of students who do not receive their free education
exemplifies this, as do the full economic and social costs
associated with them. Higher education institutions’ challenge
is developing and improving policies that will increase student
retention, particularly in the beginning years. In this paper, we
propose a methodology and a specific classification algorithm
to find a better way to trace the success and dropout of the
students, which would help universities to take the necessary
steps for their respective students. We have used decision tree,
logistic regression, naive Bayesian, and KNN algorithms and
compared them to get better prediction results from them. The
data set we used is information on undergrad degree students of
Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre, Portugal and the result we
found from the model was able to predict the students’ future
situation of their degree. This will help the education institution
and other concern institutions to make early decisions about
students for their betterment.
